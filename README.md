# Simulation of Robotic Arm using Matlab Simscape Multibody.
Modelled a 3DoF Robotic arm in MATLAB-Simscape Multibody. The robotic arm dynamic is simulated and investigated at the junction between robot arm links utilizing Simscape Multibody.
#
System architecture is presented with the name as system architecture and .slx file which contains the original simulation is added to this repository
